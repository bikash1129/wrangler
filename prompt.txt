 1. Grammar Modification (ANTLR)
Prompt:

what to do ?

You uploaded the assignment and shared the original Directives.g4 file.
I walked you through:

Adding BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION lexer rules

Adding them into the value parser rule

Creating helper fragments BYTE_UNIT, TIME_UNIT

Regenerating ANTLR lexer/parser via mvn compile

 2. API Update (Token.java)
Prompt:

give me the token.java code as you tell
give me updated code
where is timeduration and bytesize in the token.java


 3. Visitor Updates
Prompt:

next task is
there is no this kind of directory or file
i got this... now what next?

â†’ You searched for DirectivesBaseVisitor
I helped you locate RecipeVisitor.java, then:

Showed you how to modify visitValue() to support ByteSize and TimeDuration

Helped create visitByteSize() and visitTimeDuration() if required

 4. Directive Implementation
Prompt:

next task is
there is no directives directory

AggregateStats.java in executor.directives

Parsed byte/time values using string suffixes (KB, ms, etc.)

Implemented initialize, execute, and finalize methods

 5. Testing Setup
Prompt:

i have some confusion
i forgot where i have this file
i have totally confused so lets do this task again from beginning

 You were guided through:

Creating AggregateStatsTest.java in src/test/java/...

Writing 3 tests:

 Basic functionality

 Empty input

 Invalid byte value

 6. Grammar Parser Tests
Prompt:

this is my grammarBasedparserTest.java now changes here and give me full code

 I helped add:

Valid syntax test with BYTE_SIZE/TIME_DURATION

Failing test with bad syntax (123XY)

 7. README.md Changes
Prompt:

what should i write on readme.md file according to the chnages you suggested
write the full readme.md file with chnages

 I updated your README.md with:

New aggregate-stats section (syntax, arguments, example)

Example table input/output

Summary under "Available Directives"

 Final Outcome
You successfully implemented:

Lexer/parser updates

Token API extensions

Visitor class logic

A new working directive

5+ meaningful tests

Updated documentation
